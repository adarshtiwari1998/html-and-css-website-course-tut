- Why Semantic HTML is Important 
> There are Multiple Reasons, So one of them is a search engine optimization,

which basically means that a search engine such as Google

will be able to understand the structure of your content.

And therefore they will be better able to analyze

what your content and what your webpage is all about.

Also writing semantic HTML is extremely important for

accessibility and especially for people

who rely on screen readers to consume on web pages.

- when we think about HTML,

we should not only think about how it actually looks like

in the browser,

but even more about what these elements actually mean

and what they stand for.
